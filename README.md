# PageRank
The aim of this project is to calculate the PageRank scores of customers in the Amazon US customer reviews dataset.
In this repository, there are one pdf file which is the project report and three folders which are the following:
- Major Appliances
- Mobile Electronics
- Personal Care Appliances

Each one contains one notebook and 3 csv files. The three csv file are the PageRank scores, I have saved them so that it would be easier to visualize when needed and also to be able to visualize all of the scores.
The notebook in each folder is exactly the same, the only difference is the name of the CSV file on which the code operates.
